# My Awesome Django Project

Welcome to My Awesome Django Project! This README provides instructions for setting up the project locally using Docker Compose, and also offers a way to access a live demo if you prefer not to set up.

## ðŸš€ Live Demo (No Local Setup Required)

If you just want to explore the project without setting up your local environment, you can access the live demo here:

(Replace `YOUR_LIVE_DEMO_URL_HERE` with the actual URL where your project is deployed, e.g., Heroku, Render, Vercel, your own server.)
